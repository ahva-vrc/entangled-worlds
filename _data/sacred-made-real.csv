The former gained the support of Moctezuma II, Tlatoani of the Aztec Empire.

Ixtlilxochitl became from that time the enemy of Moctezuma II.

But he also sports a mascaypacha (red forehead fringe that was prerogative of an Inca ruler), and he wears sandals with puma heads. Also has an elaborate neo-Inca headpiece decorated with pre-Hispanic heraldic emblems. It bears kantutas (the Inca sacred flowers). It has a black and white feather from the corequenque (the mythical falcon used by Inca royalty as a dynastic symbol). These are juxtaposed with circular ramparts, scepters, and a rainbow (all refs to the Inca fortress above Cuzco called Sacsayhuaman). And, the flowers in the vases on either side of the figure include roses, dahlias, and white lilies. Lily is a symbol for the purity of Mary, but the lilies that appear here are the amancay, a native Peruvian lily.
